# Installing text mod
1. Move `csgo_alicesyn.txt` inside this folder: `Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\resource`

2. Add `-language alicesyn` to your CS2 launch options

## Not working? Make sure that:
* `csgo_alicesyn.txt` is placed in the correct folder (it needs to be inside the resource folder under Counter-Strike Global Offensive/**game**/csgo/resource)
* Launch option is spelled correctly, this is an example that will work: `-novid -language alicesyn`
