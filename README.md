# Installing text mod
1. Move `csgo_textmodalice.txt` inside this folder: `Steam\SteamApps\Common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource`

2. Add `-language textmodalice` to your CS:GO launch options

## Not working? Make sure that:
* `csgo_textmodalice.txt` is placed in the correct folder (it needs to be inside the resource folder)
* Launch option is spelled correctly, this is an example that will work: `-novid -language textmodalice -tickrate 128`
